Qualcomm mdss-dsi-ctrl

mdss-dsi-ctrl is a dsi controller device which supports host controllers that
are compatable with MIPI display serial interface specification.

Required properties:
- compatible:				Must be "qcom,mdss-dsi-ctrl"
- cell-index:				Specifies the controller used among the two controllers.
- reg:					offset and length of the register set for the device.
- vdd-supply:				Phandle for vdd regulator device node.
- vddio-supply:				Phandle for vdd-io regulator device node.
- vdda-supply:				Phandle for vreg regulator device node.
- qcom,mdss-fb-map:			pHandle that specifies the framebuffer to which the
					interface is mapped.

Optional properties:
- label:		        	A string used to describe the controller used.
- qcom,supply-names:			A list of strings that lists the names of the
					regulator supplies.
- qcom,supply-min-voltage-level:	A list that specifies minimum voltage level
					of supply(ies) mentioned above. This list maps
					in the order of the supply names listed above.
- qcom,supply-max-voltage-level:	A list that specifies maximum voltage level of
					supply(ies) mentioned above. This list maps in
					the order of the supply names listed above.
- qcom,supply-peak-current:		A list that specifies the peak current that will
					be drawn from the supply(ies) mentioned above. This
					list maps in the order of the supply names listed above.


Example:
        mdss_dsi0: qcom,mdss_dsi@fd922800 {
		compatible = "qcom,mdss-dsi-ctrl";
		label = "MDSS DSI CTRL->0";
		cell-index = <0>;
		reg = <0xfd922800 0x600>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8226_l15>;
		vddio-supply = <&pm8226_l8>;
		vdda-supply = <&pm8226_l4>;
		qcom,supply-names = "vdd", "vddio", "vdda";
		qcom,supply-min-voltage-level = <2800000 1800000 1200000>;
		qcom,supply-max-voltage-level = <2800000 1800000 1200000>;
		qcom,supply-peak-current = <150000 100000 100000>;
		qcom,mdss-fb-map = <&mdss_fb0>;
        };
