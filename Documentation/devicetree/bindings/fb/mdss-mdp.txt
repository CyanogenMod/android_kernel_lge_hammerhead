			writeback wfd block in MDSS as opposed to writeback
			block that is shared between rotator and wfd.

				 bank bit used.

Optional subnodes:
Child nodes representing the frame buffer virtual devices.

Subnode properties:
- compatible :		Must be "qcom,mdss-fb"
- cell-index :		Index representing frame buffer
- qcom,mdss-mixer-swap: A boolean property that indicates if the mixer muxes
			 need to be swapped based on the target panel.
			 By default the property is not defined.
- qcom,mdss-fb-split:	 Array of splitted framebuffer size. There should
			 be only two values in this property. The values
			 correspond to the left and right size respectively.
			 MDP muxes two mixer output together before sending to
			 the panel interface and these values are used to set
			 each mixer width, so the sum of these two values
			 should be equal to the panel x-resolution.

			 Note that if the sum of two values is not equal to
			 x-resolution or this subnode itself is not defined
			 in device tree there are two cases: 1)split is not
			 enabled if framebuffer size is less than max mixer
			 width; 2) the defaut even split is enabled if frambuffer
			 size is greater than max mixer width.
- qcom,memblock-reserve: Specifies the memory location and the size reserved
			 for the framebuffer used to display the splash screen.
			 This property is required whenever the continuous splash
			 screen feature is enabled for the corresponding
			 framebuffer device.
